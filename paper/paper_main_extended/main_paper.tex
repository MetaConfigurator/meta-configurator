 \begin{abstract}
 Textual formats to structure data, such as JSON, XML, and YAML, are widely used for structuring data in various domains, from configuration files to research data.
 However, managing and modifying data in these formats can be complex and time-consuming.
 While graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are effective in simplifying data management, they require substantial development and maintenance efforts.
 To address this challenge, we introduce \toolname: an innovative web application that generates its GUI depending on a given schema.
 Our approach differs from other schema-to-UI approaches in three key ways: 1) It offers a unified view that combines the benefits of both GUIs and code editors,
 2) it enables schema editing within the same tool, and 3) it supports advanced schema features, including conditions and constraints.
 In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of \toolname, backed by insights from a small-scale qualitative user study.
The results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in retrieving information from data and schemas and in editing them.

 \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction} %felix

 Textual formats to structure data, such as JSON, XML and YAML, are often used for configuration files or to structure measurement
 or research data, since they can be read and maintained by humans, as well as deserialized and used by computer programs.
 The format of data structures can be defined by so-called schemas, which define the rules the data has to conform to.
 Given a schema, it can be validated whether a particular file confirms to that schema.
 For the sake of simplicity, we will call all file instances using such formats \textit{\cfgfiles}.
 Depending on the domain of such \cfgfiles, they can be complex and time-consuming to modify and maintain.
 Tooling, such as graphical user interfaces, can significantly reduce manual efforts and assist the user in editing the files.
 Those graphical user interfaces (GUIs), however, require initial effort to be developed, as well as continuous effort in being maintained and updated when the underlying data schema changes.
 We tackle this problem by developing a web application that automatically generates such assisting GUIs, based on the given data schema.
 Our approach differs from other schema-to-UI approaches in following:

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item The tool combines the assistance of a GUI with the flexibility and speed of a code editor by providing both in one view.
  This code editor is a text editor that assists with typical features, such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error highlighting.
  \item The schema can be edited using the same tool and type of view.
  We use the same technique to generate a GUI using the \textit{meta schema} of the schema language.
  The meta schema is the schema that defines the schema language itself.
  Thus, the user is presented with a similar view for editing the schema as for editing the \cfgfiles{}.
  \item We support more complex schema features, such as conditions and constraints.
 \end{enumerate}


 In section~\ref{sec:research}, we discuss related work and existing schema formats, as well as schema-to-gui approaches.
 In section~\ref{sec:evaluation-of-schema-languages}, we evaluate existing schema languages to find the most suitable one for this work.
 Section~\ref{sec:design} describes the design and introduces the architecture of \toolname{}.
 Next, in section~\ref{sec:implementation}, we cover the implementation of \toolname{}.
 This includes a detailed description of the schema preprocessing steps, which are necessary to support some of the advanced schema features.
 To gather feedback and verify whether the tool can and will be used in the real world, we conducted a user study, which is described in section~\ref{sec:user_study}.
 We discuss the implications of the results in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.
 Finally, we conclude our work in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

%This paper addresses the challenge of managing and modifying \cfgfiles{} by introducing \toolname{}, a tool that provides a GUI for editing \cfgfiles{} based on a given schema.
% According to the criteria expressiveness and popularity, we choose JSON schema as schema format for the tool.
 This paper addresses the development of \toolname{}, a tool that generates YAML/JSON file editor GUIs tailored to a given data schema.
Our approach allows users to edit \cfgfiles{} in a GUI, while still having the flexibility and speed of a code editor.
Additionally, it removes the need for developing and maintaining a custom GUI for a particular schema.
We use JSON schema as a schema language for the tool as it is an expressive and popular schema language.
The tool is successfully implemented and our user study shows that it can be applied to solve practical tasks in 1) retrieving information from \cfgfiles{} in the context of a schema, in 2) modifying \cfgfiles{}, and in 3) editing schemas.
The interest and positive feedback of the participants suggests that \toolname{} will be used in practice.

% The text below is more suitable for a summary
%We evaluate existing schema languages by expressiveness and popularity and choose JSON schema as the most suitable for this work.
%We created a mockup showing how the tool should look like and designed the architecture, with modularity being one of the key aspects.
%For example, data formats (JSON/YAML/XML) or the different panels (GUI/rich text code editor) can be seen as building blocks that are exchangeable.
%We implemented \toolname{} according to that design.
%One of the main challenges was supporting the different JSON schema features, such as conditions and \textit{oneOf}, \textit{anyOf}, for which we introduced multiple schema preprocessing steps.

%We conducted a user study with five participants, where they had to solve particular tasks using the tool and then provide feedback about it.
%All participants provided useful suggestions for improving the tool, which we then incorporated into the tool.
%They rated \toolname{} very positively and answered that they would use it in practice.

%Finally, we outlined future work that could be done to further progress \toolname{}.
