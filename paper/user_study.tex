We conduct a qualitative user study with five participants.
During each interview, we introduce \toolname{}, give the participant tasks to execute using the tool, and finish the session with open-ended questions.
We observe how the participants work with the tool and which difficulties they have when executing the tasks.
Additionally, we ask them for feedback and improvement suggestions.
We also conduct a survey to gather demographic information about the participants of the user study.

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{subsec:research_questions}
We address the following research questions with the user study:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{RQ1:} Which aspects of the tool can be improved?
	\item \textbf{RQ2:} Are users able to perform the following types of tasks using the tool:
	 \begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{RQ2.1} Retrieve information from \cfgfiles{} in the context of a given schema
			\item \textbf{RQ2.2} Modify \cfgfiles{} within the constraints of a given schema
			\item \textbf{RQ2.3} Modify a schema file
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{RQ3:} Would people use the tool in practice?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Methodology}\label{subsec:methodology} % Minye

Our user study is qualitative and consists of five interviews.
We do not perform any major quantitative analysis of the results as the sample size is too small to draw any statistically significant conclusions.

\subsubsection{Potential Users}
We look for potential users to conduct the interviews.
We consider the following groups of people as potential users:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Professors and students who are interested in our application.
    \item People who frequently use \cfgfiles{} and schema languages
\end{itemize}
In table~\ref{tab:user_study_feedback}, the professions of the participants are listed.

\subsubsection{Interview Questions}
We created a JSON schema and \cfgfile{} for a made-up self-driving car simulation software.
All interview questions are about working with these files.
By using a made-up example, we avoid that the participants are biased by their domain knowledge.
We note, however, that besides the user study, we have applied \toolname{} on several real-world schemas (such as EnzymeML\cite{pyenzyme} and the Strenda schema\cite{strenda}) and \cfgfiles{} from the real-world, to verify that it works and does bring benefits to the user.

We divide our interview tasks into four parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Setup: We guide the participant through the setup of the tool, which involves accessing the tool via a web browser and loading the example files.
    \item Information Retrieval Questions: with increasing difficulty, the participant has to retrieve information from the \cfgfile{}.
    \item Configuration Modifications: The participant has to modify the given \cfgfile{} in various ways.
    \item Schema modifications: The participant has to modify the schema file.
\end{itemize}

The interview tasks and additional files can be found in our GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/PaulBredl/meta-configurator/tree/main/paper/userstudy}}.

\subsubsection{Interview Process}
We performed the interview with one interviewee each.
The interview lasts around one hour.
At the beginning, we ask the interviewee about approval of recording, and they can stop participating at any time.
We introduce \toolname{} to the interviewee.
Then we send the participant the tasks, an example \cfgfile{} and let them work on the tasks while sharing their screen.
During this task-solving session, we provide the interviewee with some basic help if they ask specific questions about the tool.
The interview is recorded, and we make notes of the answers, feedback, and behavior of the interviewee.
Finally, in an open dialog, we ask the interviewee for more feedback and improvement suggestions as well as their opinion on the tool.
After the interview, we ask each interviewee to fill out a survey with some questions about their background and their opinion on the tool.
%\paragraph{Survey}
%This survey covers the following points:
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Occupation of the interviewee.
%    \item Experiences in software engineering,
%    \item Frequency of working with JSON/YAML files.
%    \item Domains in which people use with JSON/YAML files.
%    \item Feedback about the application after interview.
%\end{itemize}
%Based on the survey, we could get many feedbacks which we can use in the future.
%We analyse the results which we get from the survey and improve our application afterward.

This section presents the results of the user study for each research question.

\subsubsection{\textbf{RQ1:} Which aspects of the tool can be improved?}\label{subsubsec:rq1} %Keyuri
Tables~\ref{table:user_study1}-\ref{table:user_study5} (in the appendix) show the feedback of the interviewees, as well as which measures we took based on it.


\subsubsection{\textbf{RQ2:} Are users able to perform the following types of tasks using the tool?}
Table~\ref{table:results} shows the accuracy and difficulties that the participants had when solving the tasks.
Accuracy is determined as the ratio of tasks that were solved correctly without the need for any hints to the total number of tasks.
We note that all participants were able to solve all tasks after receiving hints from the interviewer.
%With the help of hints, all tasks could be completed by every participant.


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ2.1}: Table~\ref{table:results} shows that all
    participants were able to retrieve information related to the schema and data.
    All participants were using mostly the GUI panel to retrieve information.
    Difficulties occurred when participants did not know that they could use the tooltips to get more information about the properties.
    \item \textbf{RQ2.2}: All participants were able to modify the given test file according to the given tasks.
    For some (User study 1 and 4) it was challenging to find a particular property, and they were not aware of the search functionality.
    \item \textbf{RQ2.3}: Most of the users were able to modify the schema file according to the tasks.
    The biggest difficulty was that participants did not know how to add a new property in the schema editor using the GUI panel.
\end{itemize}

Given that the average accuracy is approximately 0.9, we conclude that the participants were able to perform all three types of tasks using \toolname{}.

\subsubsection{\textbf{RQ3:} Would people use the tool in practice?} % Keyuri
Table~\ref{tab:user_study_feedback} shows the positive feedback that the participants provided and where they can imagine the tool to be used in practice.
Three of the participants highlighted the intuitiveness of \toolname.
Four of the participants explicitly describe the tool with the words ``useful'' or ``helpful''.
Additionally, all five participants responded that they would use the tool.
Consequently, this result suggests that there is a demand for \toolname{} in practice.

Note that we only include positive feedback in this table since criticism is already addressed in section~\ref{subsubsec:rq1}.

        Being able [\ldots] as a scientist [\ldots] to define what are your important properties, your schema, and then being able to [fill in the data] while running the experiment simultaneously, that would be a really, really huge advantage and the most prominent user that [comes to my mind].''

        ``I really like where this project is heading.

        \midrule
        5 & Student & Yes & ``If I have to change more things [in a JSON document] it might be very nice to do it in an interface like this, especially given that it also provides the errors [\ldots], which otherwise you would probably only get in the command line.''

        ``I guess I'm a big fan, like even though I know how to use Git on a command line level, I often use the GUI [for several tasks] because it's just faster for many things.
        And I would say [your tool] is similar to that.''


        &
        ``[I was] positively surprised, like it was super easy to [\ldots] navigate and [for example] parsing JSON is always a bit of a pain if I would have to go through this manually.
        [\ldots] It's like comparing Word and LaTeX. This felt basically like Word.
        I can just change things directly in an intuitive user interface.
        [\ldots] It is pretty nice, I would say.''

        ``Are you going to open source this?
        Because it might actually be useful.''\\

\subsection{Threats to Validity}\label{subsec:threads_to_validity} % Paul

Our user study is qualitative and only has a small sample size of 5 participants.
Hence, the results are not representative and cannot be generalized.
In addition, the tasks of the user study only cover a small subset of operations
that a user may want to perform with \toolname{} to edit \cfgfiles{} and schemas.
Due to the time constraints of the user study, we only cover rather simple tasks.
Thus, for very complex tasks, the user study is not conclusive.
%The main purpose of the user study was to get feedback on the tool and to find out whether it is useful in practice,
% which we achieved.
To get feedback on the tool and find out whether it is useful in practice, these limitations are acceptable.
For RQ2, we cannot generalize our results but only provide a first impression of how users work with \toolname{}.
