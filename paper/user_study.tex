We conduct several interviews with professors and students as potential customers.
We collect feedback from the customers to improve user experiences and fix bugs according to the feedback.
We also use a survey for demographic questions after the user study.

\subsection{Methodology}\label{subsec:methodology}

\paragraph{Potential Users}
We look for potential users to conduct the interviews.
There are two basic standards we follow to find a potential user:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Professors and students who are interested in our application.
    \item People who frequently use \cfgfiles and schema languages
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interview Questions}
We prepare our interview questions based on a mockup JSON schema and \cfgfiles.
It is about a simulation software that simulates a self-driving car.
To make it easier for interviewees to solve the questions, we divide our interview into four parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Setup Question: Where to open the application and set up schema and \cfgfiles.
    \item Basic Question: Goal is to know about the GUI of application
    \item Modifying the configuration file: Solving problems of \cfgfiles inside the \textbf{file editor}.
    \item Modifying the schema: Solving problems of JSON schema inside the \textbf{schema editor}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Interview Process}
We proceed our interview with one interviewee each time.
The interview lasts around one hour.
At the beginning, the interviewee is asked about approval of recording, and they can stop participating at any time.
One of our team member hosts the interview and guides interviewee how to use our application based on the interview question.
Another one will record the whole interview and takes notes of what are correctly and incorrectly answered.
Opinions and critical points will also be noted.
After the application test, all team members can ask the open questions and answer questions from the interviewee.

\paragraph{Survey}
After the interview, we ask each interviewee to finish a survey(follow-up questions).
This survey will cover the following points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Occupation of the interviewee.
    \item Experiences in software engineering,
    \item Frequency of working with JSON/YAML files.
    \item Domains in which people use with JSON/YAML files.
    \item Feedback about the application after interview.
\end{itemize}
Based on the survey, we could get many feedbacks which we can use in the future.
We analyse the results which we get from the survey and improve our application afterward.
