 \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction} %felix

 Textual formats to structure data, such as JSON, XML and YAML, are human-readable as well as machine-readable.

 For configuration files such formats are often used, since they can be read and maintained by humans, as well as deserialized and used by computer programs.
 The format of those data structures can be defined by so-called schemas, which define the rules the data has to conform to.
 Besides configuration files and the field of software development, other academic fields, such as Biology or Chemistry also use those formats to structure and validate their data.

 To simplify, we will call all file instances using such formats \textit{\cfgfiles}.

 Depending on the content of such \cfgfiles, they can be complex and time-consuming to modify and maintain.
 Tooling, such as graphical user interfaces, can significantly reduce manual efforts and assist the user.
 Those graphical user interfaces, however, require initial effort to be developed, as well as continuous effort in being maintained and updated when the underlying configuration schema changes.
 We intend to tackle this problem by developing a meta program that allows humans to generate such configurator GUIs, which can be shared with others.

 Our approach differs from other schema-to-UI approaches in following:

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item The tool combines the assistance of a GUI with the flexibility and speed of a rich-text editor by providing both in one view
  \item The schema can be defined using the same tool
  \item The defined schemas, the resulting configurator GUI and the modified configuration files can all be shared with others
 \end{enumerate}


 In section~\ref{sec:research} we will introduce related work and introduce existing schema formats as well as schema-to-gui approaches.
 Next we will discuss the design of our solution (section TODO).


% Summary of our approach/idea and reference the different sections, e.g. in Section 1 we will research existing work on that area and then in section 2 blabla.
