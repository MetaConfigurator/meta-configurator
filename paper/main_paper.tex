 \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction} %felix

 Textual formats to structure data, such as JSON, XML and YAML, are human-readable as well as machine-readable.

 For configuration files such formats are often used, since they can be read and maintained by humans, as well as deserialized and used by computer programs.
 The format of those data structures can be defined by so-called schemas, which define the rules the data has to conform to.
 Besides configuration files and the field of software development, other academic fields, such as Biology or Chemistry also use those formats to structure and validate their data.

 To simplify, we will call all file instances using such formats \textit{\cfgfiles}.

 Depending on the content of such \cfgfiles, they can be complex and time-consuming to modify and maintain.
 Tooling, such as graphical user interfaces, can significantly reduce manual efforts and assist the user.
 Those graphical user interfaces, however, require initial effort to be developed, as well as continuous effort in being maintained and updated when the underlying configuration schema changes.
 We intend to tackle this problem by developing a meta program that allows humans to generate such configurator GUIs, which can be shared with others.

 Our approach differs from other schema-to-UI approaches in following:

 \begin{enumerate}
  \item The tool combines the assistance of a GUI with the flexibility and speed of a rich-text editor by providing both in one view
  \item The schema can be defined using the same tool
  \item The defined schemas, the resulting configurator GUI and the modified configuration files can all be shared with others
 \end{enumerate}


 In section~\ref{sec:research} we will introduce related work and introduce existing schema formats as well as schema-to-gui approaches.
 Next we will discuss the design of our solution (section TODO).


% Summary of our approach/idea and reference the different sections, e.g. in Section 1 we will research existing work on that area and then in section 2 blabla.

 \section*{Acknowledgments}
 This should be a simple paragraph before the References to thank those individuals and institutions who have supported your work on this article.



  {\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
 Use $\backslash${\tt{appendix}} if you have a single appendix:
 Do not use $\backslash${\tt{section}} anymore after $\backslash${\tt{appendix}}, only $\backslash${\tt{section*}}.
 If you have multiple appendixes use $\backslash${\tt{appendices}} then use $\backslash${\tt{section}} to start each appendix.
 You must declare a $\backslash${\tt{section}} before using any $\backslash${\tt{subsection}} or using $\backslash${\tt{label}} ($\backslash${\tt{appendices}} by itself
 starts a section numbered zero.)}


%{\appendices

%Appendix one text goes here.
% You can choose not to have a title for an appendix if you want by leaving the argument blank
%\section*{Proof of the Second Zonklar Equation}

 \section{References Section}
 You can use a bibliography generated by BibTeX as a .bbl file.
 BibTeX documentation can be easily obtained at:
 http://mirror.ctan.org/biblio/bibtex/contrib/doc/
 The IEEEtran BibTeX style support page is:
 http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/ieeetran/bibtex/

 \bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}
 \bibliography{literature}
 % argument is your BibTeX string definitions and bibliography database(s)
%\bibliography{IEEEabrv,../bib/paper}
%


 \section{Simple References}
 You can manually copy in the resultant .bbl file and set second argument of $\backslash${\tt{begin}} to the number of references
 (used to reserve space for the reference number labels box).

%\begin{thebibliography}{1}
%\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}


%\end{thebibliography}


 \newpage


 \section{Biography Section}
 If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed), extra braces are
 needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
 the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
 $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command within an optional argument. (You can create
 your own custom macro containing the $\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} command to make things
 simpler here.)

 \vspace{11pt}

 \bf{If you include a photo:}\vspace{-33pt}
%\begin{IEEEbiography}%[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{fig1}}]{Michael %Shell}
%Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiography\}}} and then for the 1st argument use %$\backslash${\tt{includegraphics}} to declare and link the author photo.
%Use the author name as the 3rd argument followed by the biography text.
%\end{IEEEbiography}

 \vspace{11pt}

 \bf{If you will not include a photo:}\vspace{-33pt}
 \begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
  Use $\backslash${\tt{begin\{IEEEbiographynophoto\}}} and the author name as the argument followed by the biography text.
 \end{IEEEbiographynophoto}
