# MetaConfigurator Privacy Policy
MetaConfigurator is designed to respect your privacy and keep your data safe. Here’s how it works:

- **Everything stays on your computer**: When you use MetaConfigurator, the website is downloaded to your browser (just like a PDF or image would be). All the editing and processing happen directly in your browser. This means the data you type in never leaves your device. It is not sent to GitHub, our university servers, or anyone else.
- **What GitHub Pages sees**: MetaConfigurator is hosted on GitHub Pages. Like almost all websites, GitHub Pages may record basic visitor statistics (e.g., how many people visited, what browser was used, and general location like country). These are anonymous and do not include the content you type.
- **Snapshot sharing (the only exception)**: If you click the “Share Snapshot” button, your current data will be sent to and stored temporarily on a University of Stuttgart server. This allows you to share a unique link with others so they can see your snapshot. Your data is only sent when you click that button, never before.
- **No hidden tracking or ads**: MetaConfigurator does not include advertisements, tracking pixels, or third-party analytics that read your data.
- **Open Source transparency**: Our entire code is public on GitHub. Anyone can verify that we do not secretly send your information anywhere.
