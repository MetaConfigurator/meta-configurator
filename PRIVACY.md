# MetaConfigurator Privacy Policy
MetaConfigurator is designed to respect your privacy and keep your data safe. Here’s how it works:

## Everything stays on your computer

When you use MetaConfigurator, the website is downloaded to your browser (just like a PDF or image would be). All the editing and processing happen directly in your browser. This means the data you type in never leaves your device. It is not sent to GitHub, our university servers, or anyone else. Exceptions: when using the Snapshot sharing or AI-assistance features.

## What GitHub Pages sees

MetaConfigurator is hosted on GitHub Pages. Like almost all websites, GitHub Pages may record basic visitor statistics (e.g., how many people visited, what browser was used, and general location like country). These are anonymous and do not include the content you type.

## Snapshot sharing

If you click the “Share Snapshot” button, your current data will be sent to and stored temporarily on a University of Stuttgart server. This allows you to share a unique link with others so they can see your snapshot. Your data is only sent when you click that button.

## Optional AI-assisted features

MetaConfigurator now offers optional AI-assisted functionality. To use these features, you must provide an AI endpoint and authentication token. When an AI feature is used, the relevant data (for example, the text to be edited, schema information, and the user prompt) is securely combined and sent to your specified AI endpoint for processing.
If no AI endpoint or authentication key is provided, or if no AI-related feature is used, no data is transferred to any AI service or endpoint.

## No hidden tracking or ads

MetaConfigurator does not include advertisements, tracking pixels, or third-party analytics that read your data.

## Open Source transparency

Our entire code is public on GitHub. Anyone can verify that we do not secretly send your information anywhere.
