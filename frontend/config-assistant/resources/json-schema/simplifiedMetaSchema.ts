/**
 * This represents a simplified version of the json schema meta schema.
 * We made the following changes:
 * - usage of if/then/else instead to only show relevant fields depending on the type
 * - usage of $comment to give a link to the original documentation
 * - added descriptions to most fields
 * - added custom metaConfigurator field to hide advanced fields
 * - usage of $ref instead of anchors because we don't support anchors and dynamic anchors
 * - added examples to some fields
