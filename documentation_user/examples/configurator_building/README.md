MetaConfigurator as a Configurator Builder
==========================================

MetaConfigurator can be used as a **Configurator Builder**, allowing users to create and share URLs that open MetaConfigurator with preloaded schema, data, and settings. This enables a customized experience tailored to a specific use case.

Constructing a Preloaded URL
----------------------------

You can construct a MetaConfigurator URL that preloads a schema, data file, and settings file by appending query parameters:

*   **Schema**: ?schema=schemaUrl

*   **Data**: ?data=dataUrl

*   **Settings**: ?settings=settingsUrl

*   **Combination**: ?schema=schemaUrl&data=dataUrl&settings=settingsUrl


Each of these parameters is optional, allowing flexibility in what gets preloaded.

### Example


```https://metaconfigurator.github.io/meta-configurator/?schema=https://github.com/MetaConfigurator/meta-configurator/blob/main/documentation_user/examples/configurator_building/synthesis.schema.json&settings=https://github.com/MetaConfigurator/meta-configurator/blob/main/documentation_user/examples/configurator_building/configurator_settings.json```
This URL will open MetaConfigurator with the provided schema, data, and settings preloaded.
Try here: [Open MetaConfigurator with Preloaded Schema and Settings](https://metaconfigurator.github.io/meta-configurator/?schema=https://github.com/MetaConfigurator/meta-configurator/blob/main/documentation_user/examples/configurator_building/synthesis.schema.json&settings=https://github.com/MetaConfigurator/meta-configurator/blob/main/documentation_user/examples/configurator_building/configurator_settings.json)

Customizing the User Interface
------------------------------

The settings file allows fine-grained control over the MetaConfigurator interface, including:

*   **Custom Title**: Define a custom title displayed in the menu bar.

*   **Font and UI Styles**: Adjust fonts and layout settings.

*   **Visible Panels**: Choose which panels are shown (e.g., GUI view, text view, schema diagram).

*   **Mode Restrictions**: Hide schema editor mode or settings editor mode to simplify the UI for end users.


### Preserving the Interface State

To ensure a consistent user experience, simply configure the interface by opening the panels you want, then copy the settings.
The settings file will store the currently visible panels and UI configurations, ensuring the same view when shared.

Use Case: Hiding Schema Complexity
----------------------------------

This approach allows users to interact only with the data view while keeping the schema editor hidden.
By doing so, MetaConfigurator acts as a custom configurator for a specific domain, making it more user-friendly for non-technical users.

Sharing and Shortening URLs
---------------------------

The generated URLs can be shared with others for easy access. 
For convenience, long URLs can be shortened using URL shorteners before sharing, using external tools.

Real-World Example: preCICE Adapter Configuration
-------------------------------------------------

A practical example of this feature is in the [preCICE](https://www.precice.org/) multi-physics coupling library.
MetaConfigurator is used to provide a UI for configuring standardized solver adapters.
The full implementation can be found in their repository:

[preCICE Adapter Configuration Schema](https://github.com/precice/preeco-orga/tree/main/adapter-config-schema)

By leveraging MetaConfigurator in this way, users can create specialized configurators tailored to their specific needs without exposing unnecessary complexity.
